# Page link prefetch

The Pages router exposes programmatic prefetch and the framework Link
components expose prefetch strategies. Prefetch warms the component module,
page data, or island/markdown HTML as appropriate for the route. GET links
are eligible; mutation links are not.

Prefetched page responses are cached with a configured lifetime and reused
by navigation while valid. The server resolves deferred props before sending
a prefetch response, so the cache holds a complete page object. This keeps
prefetch an optimization of the existing navigation protocol.

The implementation is in
[Pages prefetch](../../../packages/void/src/pages/prefetch.ts) and the
[Pages client](../../../packages/void/src/pages/client.ts).
